### Notepad App

## Task 1: Create a Header that will be displayed across all pages

The header component needs to have a Title of your application & have a Clear All button to clear
the list from storage

## Task 2: Create a Homepage that displays the list of notes

The homepage needs to display the current list of notes stored in local storage.
A note is an object with a “title” & “content” property. The list is an array of note objects.
The homepage will also need to have an Add Note button below the list to navigate the user to
the Add Note page.

## Task 3: Create a Row component (Homepage)

Create a functional component called Row.
Each row in the list on the homepage needs to use a Row component to display the note title and
a delete button.
When delete is clicked the current note is removed from the list of notes.
When a row is clicked the user is sent to the Edit Note page.

## Task 4: Create an Add Note page

The Add Note page will need to have a form that allows a user to add a note.
A note will have a ‘title’ and a ‘content’ property.
Title will be a regular input and content will be a textarea.
The form data will need to be stored using session storage.
There needs to be an Add Note button that submits the form and adds a new note using the form
data. The form data should also be cleared from session storage on click. The user should also be
navigated back to the previous page when submitting the form

## Task 5: Create an Edit Note page

The Edit Note page will need to have a form that allows a user to edit a note.
The user can edit the ‘title’ and ‘content’ property of a note.
There needs to be a Save Note button that submits the form and updates the note. The user
should also be navigated back to the previous page when submitting the form.

## Task 6:

Use an npm package in your application - you must implement at least 1 npm package of your
choice (other than react-router) in your application (https://www.npmjs.com/)

# NPM Packages

https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
